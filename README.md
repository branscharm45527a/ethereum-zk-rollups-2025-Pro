## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how advanced blockchain technology will integrate with the traditional financial interfaces of exchanges.

Let's break down how Ethereum ZK-Rollups integrate with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management. It's crucial to understand that this integration is not a single, simple plug-and-play but a multi-layered process involving both on-chain and off-chain components.

### The Core Concept: Two Layers Working Together

Think of it as a division of labor:

*   **ZK-Rollups (Layer 2):** The high-speed, low-cost **execution and settlement layer**. This is where your automated trading strategies can interact with DeFi protocols (like Uniswap, Aave) with minimal fees and maximum speed, and where your portfolio is actively managed.
*   **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs like Binance):** The **on/off-ramp and liquidity hub**. This is where you convert fiat (USD, EUR) to crypto, hold assets not yet supported on L2, and access deep, centralized liquidity for large trades.

The goal of integration is to move assets and data seamlessly between these two worlds
